{"name":"Tunlr Clone","tagline":"Use a cheap VPS to make a Tunlr Clone","body":"#Tunlr Clone#\r\nTo build a tunlr or UnoTelly or unblock-us.com (or other DNS-based\r\nservices) clone on the cheap, you need to invest in a VPS.  For the\r\npurposes of this discussion, I am assuming that you will be using\r\nthis for watching US geo-locked content.\r\n\r\n##US IP Address##\r\nYour VPS provider must provide you with an exteral IP address with\r\npresence in the US.\r\n\r\n##VPS Provider Specific Terminology##\r\nMy VPS provider is [buyvm](http://buyvm.net/).  I have an OpenVZ\r\n128m plan with them hosted in New Jersey (running Debian 7).  So, the\r\nvenet0 references that you will see pertain to that VPS provider.\r\n\r\n##Disclaimer##\r\nThis information is provided as is without warranty of any kind,\r\neither express or implied, including but not limited to the implied\r\nwarranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.\r\nIn no event shall the author be liable for any damages whatsoever\r\nincluding direct, indirect, incidental consequential, loss of\r\nbusiness profits, or special damages.\r\n\r\nIf you leave your DNS server or HTTPS-SNI-Proxy server wide open to\r\nabuse, that's on your own head.  Take precautions in this regard.\r\nProceed at your own risk.\r\n\r\nAlso this is not meant to be a hold-your-hand start from scratch\r\ntutorial.  Therefore, some level of Linux expertise is necessary.\r\n\r\n##Background##\r\nBasically we are interested in proxying content only for certain\r\ngeo-locked domains.  The actual streaming media sits on CDNs and is\r\nusually not geo-locked.  The amount of proxying we'll end up doing\r\nwill be relatively insignificant compared to a VPN-based setup (where\r\neverything must be proxied). The outlined solution will typically\r\nresult in significant bandwidth savings.\r\n\r\n[![How Tunlr Cloning works](https://raw.github.com/corporate-gadfly/Tunlr-Clone/master/tunlr-clone.png)](https://raw.github.com/corporate-gadfly/Tunlr-Clone/master/tunlr-clone.png)\r\n\r\nUser browses to Hulu homepage. Behind the scenes, this triggers the\r\nfollowing sequence of events:\r\n\r\n1. Browsing device asks for the IP address of www.hulu.com (using DNS).\r\n1. If the router is not running `dnsmasq`, it sends the DNS\r\n   query for www.hulu.com to DNS server running on the VPS.\r\n1. The VPS DNS server responds with the IP address of VPS SNI Server as the\r\n   authorative answer for the DNS query.\r\n1. If the router is running `dnsmasq`, it directly sends the resolved\r\n   IP address back to browsing device. Otherwise, it has to wait for DNS\r\n   resolution from steps 2 and 3 (above).\r\n1. Browsing device sends a request for content for www.hulu.com.\r\n1. VPS SNI Server sends a request for content to www.hulu.com.\r\n1. Since the VPS SNI Server has an IP presence in USA, www.hulu.com\r\n   responds with proper content.\r\n1. VPS SNI Server proxies the content back to the browsing device\r\n\r\nIt is pertinent to point out that if your router is dnsmasq-capable,\r\nthen, you could bypass steps 2 and 3 (go directly from step 1 straight\r\nto 4) by having `dnsmasq` resolve the address of relevant domains.\r\n\r\n##Routers capable of dnsmasq (e.g., those running Tomato)##\r\nIf the stock firmware of your router supports `dnsmasq` or if your\r\nrouter is capable of running Tomato, then, you can use `dnsmasq` for\r\nyour DNS-resolution needs.\r\n\r\nFollowing is my `dnsmasq` configuration on my Tomato-based router\r\n(running a Toastman build):\r\n`Advanced -> DHCP/DNS -> Dnsmasq Custom configuration`\r\n```bash\r\n# Never forward plain names (without a dot or domain part)\r\ndomain-needed\r\n# Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces.\r\nbogus-priv\r\n\r\n# If you don't want dnsmasq to read /etc/resolv.conf or any other\r\n# file, getting its servers from this file instead (see below), then\r\n# uncomment this.\r\nno-resolv\r\n\r\n# If you don't want dnsmasq to poll /etc/resolv.conf or other resolv\r\n# files for changes and re-read them then uncomment this.\r\nno-poll\r\n\r\n# tunlr for hulu\r\naddress=/hulu.com/199.x.x.x\r\naddress=/huluim.com/199.x.x.x\r\naddress=/netflix.com/199.x.x.x\r\n# tunlr for US networks\r\n# cbs works with link.theplatform.com\r\naddress=/abc.com/abc.go.com/199.x.x.x\r\naddress=/fox.com/link.theplatform.com/199.x.x.x\r\naddress=/nbc.com/nbcuni.com/199.x.x.x\r\naddress=/pandora.com/199.x.x.x\r\naddress=/ip2location.com/199.x.x.x\r\n# espn3 \r\naddress=/broadband.espn.go.com/199.x.x.x\r\n\r\n# Google\r\nserver=8.8.8.8\r\nserver=8.8.4.4\r\n# OpenDNS\r\n#server=208.67.222.222\r\n#server=208.67.220.220\r\n```\r\n`199.x.x.x` is the IP address of my VPS server (where my SNI proxy server will\r\nalso be running). See next section(s).\r\n\r\nIn essence, I am resolving DNS queries to point to my VPS only for the\r\nspecified domains.  Everything else goes to Google DNS (or can\r\neasily go to your ISP DNS). This means that CDN-hosted media DNS\r\nresolution will not be going to our Linux VPS.\r\n\r\n##Routers incapable of running dnsmasq##\r\nIf you have a router which does not support running `dnsmasq` (either\r\nvia the stock firmware or is not Tomato-capable), then, you will have to\r\npoint all of your DNS queries to a DNS server running in your\r\ncontrol on your VPS.\r\n\r\n##Your own DNS Server running on VPS##\r\nIn the situation where my router is incapable of running `dnsmasq` I\r\nwill have to run a DNS server (e.g., bind9) on my VPS. The plan is to send the external IP address of my VPS as the resolved IP address for any of the relevant domains.\r\nEverything else will be forwarded to another DNS for resolution.\r\n\r\nOnce the web traffic hits my VPS, I use iptables to limit access to\r\ntraffic provided by\r\n[HTTPS-SNI-Proxy](https://github.com/dlundquist/HTTPS-SNI-Proxy)\r\nrunning on port 80/443 (since currently HTTPS-SNI-Proxy does not have ACL\r\ncapability).\r\n\r\nHere is the bind9 config:\r\n\r\n`/etc/bind/named.conf.options`\r\n```nginx\r\noptions {\r\n    directory \"/var/cache/bind\";\r\n\tforwarders {\r\n        # these are the DNS servers from the VPS provider (look in /etc/resolv.conf if yours are different)\r\n\t\t199.195.255.68;\r\n\t\t199.195.255.69;\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\tauth-nxdomain no;
